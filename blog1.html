        And it’s not hard to say why because 'Technology has been growing so exponentially over some past years!'.  There has been a gradual increase in demand for bright graduates to return in and help to rework areas starting from artificial intelligence to virtual reality. The future seems very fascinating. There's no doubt that the essential idea of digital transformation is going to be a reality with innovation growing at an incredible rate of growth.
So, if you have an interest in computer science and want to pursue a career in it, then it is important to stay up to date with the latest technological advancements for a promising career with better opportunities. 
Well, here are some emerging technology trends that you should be looking for!
<h3>1.	Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML)</h3>

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the parts of computer science that are correlated with each other. These two technologies are the most trending technologies nowadays which are used for creating intelligent systems. Artificial intelligence is a technology that we can use to create intelligent systems that can simulate human intelligence and Machine learning is actually a subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being directly programmed.
Although these technologies are still is in its intermediate stages, but tech giants like Facebook, Google, IBM, and many more are investing huge amounts of money and resources into their research and development. And more importantly, ML and AI are here to stay so, there’s certainly no shortage of opportunities to develop real-world applications of these technologies, and immense scope for break-through moments in these fields.
<h3>2.	Cyber Security</h3>
In today’s world, data protection is not any longer optional, for either businesses or individuals, making this another emerging trend of computer science.
Cyber Security is the process of protecting your computer operating systems, networks, and data from cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks are usually aimed toward accessing someone's data, or changing it, or destroying sensitive information, or it can be extorting money from users, or maybe interrupting normal business processes.
 

In this digital era, there are endless opportunities for hackers and cyber terrorists to target people, government institutions, and even big business. So, there are various top organizations that are willing to pay a lot for cyber analysts who can protect their data and remove vulnerabilities to defend against cyber attacks and security breaches. Also, some recent stats have shown that the number of cybersecurity workers is rising three times faster than other technical jobs, evidence of the strong need for cybersecurity experts.
<h3>3.	Virtual Reality</h3>
 

Virtual reality is an emerging technology that has resulted in rapid expansion in the development of varied virtual environments. Most of the people have a reasonably good understanding of what virtual reality actually seems like. It changes our digital environment. Movies and shows will primarily be in VR. We’ll do virtual exercise, play virtual games, and have the privilege of doing any hobby in VR. Other tech is pretty unrelated to entertainment.
There are many companies within the VR market, like Google, Samsung, and Oculus, also there are many start-ups emerging and recruiting, and therefore the demand for VR professionals will only grow. 
As it does not require tons of specialized knowledge to get started in virtual reality. Basic programming skills and forward-thinking mentality can land you employment, although some employers will also search for optics as a skill set and hardware engineers.
<h3>
4.	Edge Computing </h3>
Recently a new field, edge computing emerged in the bubble of computer science and is promised to flourish more in future. Edge computing is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data, instead of relying on the cloud at one of a dozen data centers to do all the work .As you reduce the distance the speed of electrons being essentially constant, you minimize the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer.
 

Its demand is increasing day by day as it offers everything required in the industry with customized factors from the development level. Computing, storing and networking and other features of edge computing will incorporate flexibility and allows faster responses, which will help to handle current and future demands of artificial intelligence, data analytics etc.
Summary
Here we come to the end of our blog. In this blog, we had a brief description of the some latest technologies that are Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, Edge Computing, Virtual Reality and Cyber Security in detail. These technologies in computer science are storming the industry. I would also like to tell you these are not only technologies that’s been doing good in computer science, it is just that they seem to have bright future in industry.
